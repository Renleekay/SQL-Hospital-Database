Hospital Database Project

This project is a comprehensive relational database system designed to manage the core operations of a hospital. It includes all major documentation and assets necessary for database development, analysis, and deployment.

##Contents
- `hospital_database.sql`: The detached database file for importing into SQL environments (MSSQL).
- `relational_schema.vsdx`: A document showing all tables, attributes, and their relationships.
- `ERD.vsdx`: The Entity-Relationship Diagram that visually represents the logical structure of the database.
- `EERD.vsdx`: The Enhanced ERD which includes specialization, generalization, and other advanced modeling features.
- `data_dictionary.docx`: A spreadsheet that details each attribute, data type, constraints, and description.
- `ADD.pdf`: The Attribute Definition Document, which provides deeper context on the meaning and purpose of each data field.

##Objectives
- Model a real-world hospital system using relational database principles.
- Design logical and enhanced entity relationships for healthcare operations.
- Demonstrate normalization, constraint enforcement, and data integrity.
- Provide documentation for both technical and stakeholder-level understanding.

##Tools & Tech
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Microsoft Word
- Microsoft Visio

##Notes
This database is intended for academic purposes. It simulates real-world structures but does not include actual patient data.
